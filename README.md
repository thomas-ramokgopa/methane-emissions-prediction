# Predictive Modelling for Methane (CH₄) Emissions Estimation

**MSc Business Analytics Consultancy Project/Dissertation 2024-25**

This project develops supervised machine learning models to predict methane (CH₄) emissions from UK facilities using spatial, sectoral, and climate data.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build predictive models that can estimate methane emissions using contextual data sources, including:

- **Climate conditions**: Temperature, rainfall, wind speed, pressure
- **Spatial and geographic context**: Urbanicity, region, population density
- **Sectoral and operator-level metadata**: Industry sector, facility operator information

## Objectives

- Train and evaluate multiple regression models to estimate CH₄ emissions
- Compare performance across model types using standard metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)
- Use SHAP values to interpret model predictions and identify key drivers
- Extract spatial, sectoral, and environmental insights relevant to climate policy

## Dataset

The modeling dataset combines:

- **Point Source Emissions Data**: Methane emissions reported by UK facilities (2018–2022)
- **Climate Grid Data**: High-resolution NetCDF files with monthly climate observations (1 km × 1 km grid)

### Data Sources
- Historical point-source emissions (2018–2022)
- Sector-level and geographic metadata
- High-resolution climate variables from NetCDF grids

## Methodology

### Models Implemented
- Baseline Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- LightGBM Regressor (optional)
- Neural Network (MLPRegressor)

### Evaluation Metrics
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### Model Explainability
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for feature importance analysis
